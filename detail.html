                <p>
                    Hello world, I am Hello World.
                    How are you doing, Hello World.
                    I am doing great today, I was just born.
                    That is great to hear, have you greeted the world yet?
                    Not yet, but I am about to.
                    What will you say.
                    Hello World.
                </p>

                        Rolling, rolling, rolling, oh.
                        Rolling, rolling, rolling, ah.
                        Spinning, spinning, spinning, oh.
                        Spinning, spinning, spinning, ah.
                        Twirling, twirling, twirling, oh.

                        So 90% of what I am writing is complete nonsense.
                        That is mainly because I am just writing what comes to the top of my head.
                        Which can become pretty random at times.
                        So whoever is reading this message, I apologize.
                        I must seem really crazy.
                        Which honestly, I kind of am.
